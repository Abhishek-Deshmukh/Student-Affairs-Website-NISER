## Student Life

NISER, located at the suburb of Bhubaneswar, is surrounded by greenery and nature. With the verdure giving the much needed harmony and calmness, the lives of the students here is an ideal balance of efforts and enjoyment. Major tourist spots are within 50 km range of the institute and the accessibility to the capital city through the university bus service gives the students the options to explore a myriad of ancient architectures, cultural sites, recreational activities. The students joining the institute can expect themselves to work in a positive and rational environment. The freshers/new members need not worry about how to fit in the scene. There is a strong inter-batch relationship with the students coming to help each other. Likewise, the teacher-student relationship at NISER is in fine feather. The students are always welcomed to discuss the doubts and to ask guidance related to academic matters with professors. The workload at NISER is manageable and gives the students good enough leisure time to hone their extra curricular skills and to let themselves participate in sports and fitness.


## Hostels

There are 9 hostels (4 double occupancy hostels and 5 single occupancy hostels) situated within the campus for housing the students of NISER. The boys and girls are housed in separate hostels. All the hostels have furnished bedrooms, 24/7 desk services and high speed LAN connection in each room. The hostels are assisted with laundry facilities, common room for gatherings, cable TV, mail service and night time security patrols. Any hostel related problem communicated through the elected Hostel Executive Committee (HEC) members to the caretakers or the warden. The students are expected to be within the hostel before 11 pm and are not allowed to invite restricted people to their rooms.
