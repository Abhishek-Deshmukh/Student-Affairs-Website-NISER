## Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)

NISER is monitoring the evolving impacts of the COVID-19 virus in India and its possible impact on the NISER community.

A team comprising members of senior management from across NISER, as well as health and safety and other relevant experts, meets daily to assess the situation and to decide on appropriate actions for NISER, taking into account the advice of expert external authorities. Our highest priority is to protect the health of NISER members and of everyone on the site, while allowing NISER to continue working throughout this difficult time. All measures are decided with this overarching objective in mind.

By now it has been recognised that the virus may go through four stages of development that the expert health authorities have identified.



*   Stage I - Alert of the spreading of the virus by WHO
*   Stage II - A Host-State declares part of its territory, distant from NISER, as affected or threatened by an outbreak of COVID-19. The objective in this phase is to prevent and limit the spread of the virus.
*   Stage III - The virus circulates widely in the area in which NISER is located
*   Stage IV - Infection spreads at NISER itself.
