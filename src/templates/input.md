# CAMPUS LIFE


## Student Life

NISER, located at the suburb of Bhubaneswar, is surrounded by greenery and nature. With the verdure giving the much needed harmony and calmness, the lives of the students here is an ideal balance of efforts and enjoyment. Major tourist spots are within 50 km range of the institute and the accessibility to the capital city through the university bus service gives the students the options to explore a myriad of ancient architectures, cultural sites, recreational activities. The students joining the institute can expect themselves to work in a positive and rational environment. The freshers/new members need not worry about how to fit in the scene. There is a strong inter-batch relationship with the students coming to help each other. Likewise, the teacher-student relationship at NISER is in fine feather. The students are always welcomed to discuss the doubts and to ask guidance related to academic matters with professors. The workload at NISER is manageable and gives the students good enough leisure time to hone their extra curricular skills and to let themselves participate in sports and fitness.


## Hostels

There are 9 hostels (4 double occupancy hostels and 5 single occupancy hostels) situated within the campus for housing the students of NISER. The boys and girls are housed in separate hostels. All the hostels have furnished bedrooms, 24/7 desk services and high speed LAN connection in each room. The hostels are assisted with laundry facilities, common room for gatherings, cable TV, mail service and night time security patrols. Any hostel related problem communicated through the elected Hostel Executive Committee (HEC) members to the caretakers or the warden. The students are expected to be within the hostel before 11 pm and are not allowed to invite restricted people to their rooms. Students are expected to follow the hostel rules as defined in the attached pdf. [Hostel Rules pdf.](https://www.niser.ac.in/docs/2017/hostel_rules.pdf) Any action violating the rules of the hostel community might lead to punitive measures as decided by the authorities. Disciplinary Action Structure for violation of hostel rule is given in [attached pdf here](https://www.niser.ac.in/docs/2019/disciplinary_action_hostel.pdf). For more details on the hostel rules and facilities please visit ([the hostel site](https://www.niser.ac.in/hostels/)).

Every year, hostel days are celebrated wherein various competitions are organised for the residents. These functions are closed with a grand party. The sole aim of these functions and events is to make a sociable and interactive environment for the students to live in.


## Food & Dining

The catering services are available at 4 hostels in NISER. The food can either be ordered for a takeaway service or can be enjoyed in the dining halls of the hostels within the scheduled time table. The menus of the canteens are pre-decided and are flexible. There are regular inspections on the food quality and services of the caterers by the mess-in-charge of each hostel.  A night canteen has also been set-up at the Students Activity Centre which functions when the hostel canteens are closed. Any problems with the food quality or the services in the Mess can be brought into notice with the help of mess incharges of the hostel.


## Services in NISER

NISER has kept in mind the services a person can need during their stay in the campus and has made available a scheduled transportation system, a shopping complex, banks and post-office within the premises. NISER has its own bus service which shuttles between NISER Campus and Bhubaneswar. The shopping complex provides space for stationary shops, general utility store, fast food corners. Two bank branches, namely State Bank of India (SBI) and Indian Overseas Bank (IOB), are located within the premises of NISER. One branch of Indian Post Office is located inside the Campus too.

## Discipline

The students of NISER are expected to follow a strict code of conduct. They are supposed to act in a manner which shows their belonging to an institute of national importance. Their behaviour or any activity should not bring down the prestige of the Institute. Any action which violates the rules ensuring the safety and freedom of all the other members may be considered as violation of the code of conduct and may invite a disciplinary action against the doer. The rules laid down by the authorities for maintaining the decorum of the institute should be given utmost importance. For more details on such rules and regulations can be read in section 12 of [the attached pdf.](https://www.niser.ac.in/docs/2012/UGManual(Latest).pdf)


## Sports

NISER has been active in Sports and Fitness. We have an instructor to help with the training and for increasing the participation of students in the sports activities. NISER has a Sports club which has sub groups in it where all the games of both men and women are given equal importance. The club has weekly practice sessions with the instructor so that the students can hone their skills in the favored sport. Inter batch tournaments are held regularly to boost healthy competition among the players and help them prepare for the Inter-College Tournaments. [Aranya Giri, put your input here]
