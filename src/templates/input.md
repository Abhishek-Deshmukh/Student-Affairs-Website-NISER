**Indian Film Project:** (9 Oct., 2019) The Film Club participated in the India Film Project (IFP) season 9 in October. IFP is Asiaâs largest content fest and saw over 36,000 filmmakers participating and producing 1,710 short films! The participation came from 320 cities and 18 countries, with teams from USA, UK, Australia, Turkey, Dubai, Singapore and many more. The challenge was to make a short film on a given theme in 50 hours, and we delivered! Nobody can forget the memories we made in the short span of 2 days and it would be a disservice to attempt to describe how much we learnt as budding filmmakers

**Blood Donation Camp:** (Sept 2019) A blood donation camp was successfully organised by Zaariya in association with Sahaya at Students Activity Centre(SAC) in NISER on Tuesday, September 10, 2019. The blood donation drive was organised in collaboration with Capital Hospital, one of the oldest government hospitals in Bhubaneswar. In this event, a total 100 people participated in donating blood for a noble cause. Each person donated 1 unit of blood and a total number of 100 units of blood was collected.

**Movie Marathon:** (Sept, 2019) Every year the Film Club conducts two movie marathon events. One is held in the odd semester(usually in September) and one in the even semester(during the Oscar week). These are very warmly appreciated by the community and we see turnouts in huge numbers. Last year we had a short film marathon in the odd semester in which we showed a curated collection of award winning short films like Two by Satyajit Ray and Room 8 which won a BAFTA in 2014. The Oscar marathon is one of the most anticipated events of the club and last year it comprised three spectacular movies namely: Lady Bird, Jo Jo Rabbit and The Lighthouse.

**Chandrayaan 2:** (7 Sept, 2019) Astronomy Club. Prof. J. N. Goswami, the chief scientist of Chandrayaan 1 was invited as the chief speaker in a public outreach event.

**Debashis Jena Memorial Tournament (DJMT):** (Sept 6- Oct 3, 2019) The Niser Individuals Tournament is named in memory of one of our institute's greatest sportsmen, **Debashish Jena, **who played a pivotal role in setting up the chess club. This tournament is considered as the selection tournament for the chess team that will go on to represent NISER in IISM. **27** members participated in the 2019 edition of DJMT and the top 6 were selected for IISM. Over the years, DJMT has grown popular among the NISER fraternity. The club is in pursuit of methods to increase the number of participants, a move that intends to increase our bench strength in IISM.

**SPICMACAY Classical Concert:** (19 Aug, 2019) DMC : An early morning Hindustani classical vocal concert by Indian classical vocal artist Pt. Jayateertha Mevundi ji.

**Koffee With Kishore:** (10 Aug 2019) DMC : An cultural event organised on the occasion of the birthday of Kishore Kumar . It showcases drama, music, dance, stand up comedy and any other mode of entertainment that one can think of.

**Inter-Batch Chess Tournament: **(Aug 2019) The Inter-Batch Tournament **(IBT)**, is a key event of the chess club which is aimed towards bringing the players of different batches together as a team and gauge their overall performance. Each batch puts out a team of 6(5 players and 1 sub), and a Swiss style team tournament is held. IBT helps to introduce the freshers batch to the chess culture in place already.

The 2019 edition of IBT saw the participation of Batches 15,16,17,18 and 19. Batch 15, in their last ever IBT came out on top, while Batch 18 were the runners up.

**Pragyan Demonstration Model:** (July 2019) RoboTech Club, NAC

RoboTech Club in collaboration with NAC developed a working demonstrative model of PRAGYAN Rove, which was on-board the Chandrayaan â II Mission of ISRO. Our Model was featured in the Chandrayaan II Launch event organised in NISER by School of Earth and Planetary Science (SEPS), NISER. Our model was a major point of attraction among many AV Media who covered this event.

**IISM 2018:** (15-20 Dec, 2018) Sports Club

NISER hosted the IISM 2018, inviting contingents from 9 other participating institutes, coordinating their stay and practice and organising all events of the sports meet on campus.

# CAMPUS LIFE


## Student Life

NISER, located at the suburb of Bhubaneswar, is surrounded by greenery and nature. With the verdure giving the much needed harmony and calmness, the lives of the students here is an ideal balance of efforts and enjoyment. Major tourist spots are within 50 km range of the institute and the accessibility to the capital city through the university bus service gives the students the options to explore a myriad of ancient architectures, cultural sites, recreational activities. The students joining the institute can expect themselves to work in a positive and rational environment. The freshers/new members need not worry about how to fit in the scene. There is a strong inter-batch relationship with the students coming to help each other. Likewise, the teacher-student relationship at NISER is in fine weather. The students are always welcomed to discuss the doubts and to ask guidance related to academic matters with professors. The workload at NISER is manageable and gives the students good enough leisure time to hone their extra curricular skills and to let themselves participate in sports and fitness.


## Hostels

There are 9 hostels (4 double occupancy hostels and 5 single occupancy hostels) situated within the campus for housing the students of NISER. The boys and girls are housed in separate hostels. All the hostels have furnished bedrooms, 24/7 desk services and high speed LAN connection in each room. The hostels are assisted with laundry facilities, common room for gatherings, cable TV, mail service and night time security patrols. Any hostel related problem communicated through the elected Hostel Executive Committee (HEC) members to the caretakers or the warden. The students are expected to be within the hostel before 11 pm and are not allowed to invite restricted people to their rooms. Students are expected to follow the hostel rules as defined in the attached pdf. [Hostel Rules pdf.](https://www.niser.ac.in/docs/2017/hostel_rules.pdf) Any action violating the rules of the hostel community might lead to punitive measures as decided by the authorities. Disciplinary Action Structure for violation of hostel rule is given in [attached pdf here](https://www.niser.ac.in/docs/2019/disciplinary_action_hostel.pdf). For more details on the hostel rules and facilities please visit ([the hostel site](https://www.niser.ac.in/hostels/)).

Every year, hostel days are celebrated wherein various competitions are organised for the residents. These functions are closed with a grand party. The sole aim of these functions and events is to make a sociable and interactive environment for the students to live in.


## Food & Dining

The catering services are available at 4 hostels in NISER. The food can either be ordered for a takeaway service or can be enjoyed in the dining halls of the hostels within the scheduled time table. The menus of the canteens are pre-decided and are flexible. There are regular inspections on the food quality and services of the caterers by the mess-in-charge of each hostel.  A night canteen has also been set-up at the Students Activity Centre which functions when the hostel canteens are closed. Any problems with the food quality or the services in the Mess can be brought into notice with the help of mess incharges of the hostel.


## Services in NISER

NISER offers a solid foundation for students to begin their careers in science.


## Discipline

The students of NISER are expected to follow a strict code of conduct and act in a manner befitting the institute. Any activity or behaviour which violates the rules ensuring the safety and freedom of all the other members may be considered as violation of the code of conduct and may invite a disciplinary action against the doer, ranging from reprimand to suspension. The rules laid down by the authorities for maintaining the decorum of the institute should be given utmost importance. For more details on such rules and regulations can be read in section 12 of [the attached pdf.](https://www.niser.ac.in/docs/2012/UGManual(Latest).pdf)

They overlook all the sports activities and aim to increase students participation in sports by arranging various tournaments every semester. Captains regulate the  weekly practice session to hone the skills of newcomers as well the veterans.

Like, one of the most anticipated Intra-NISER sports events is the Inter-batch tournaments held every semester. Not only students but the faculties and staff also participate with their team for a healthy competition. This tournament has a tradition that newcomers will do all the necessary arrangements.
